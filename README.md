# Data-Driven Bayesian Parameter Estimation with Neural Networks

This Repository consists of the main document of my Bachelor's Thesis called "Data-driven Bayesian Parameter Estimation with Neural Networks", along with the Code needed to reproduce my findings.

## experiment plans

### Synthetic-Data

#### Frequency Dynamics

- how do i simulate the best data, with respect to computation resources?
  - frequency dynamics and their modeling
  - 

### Empirical-Data

- this should be more topic specific and results in real data experiments

### Questions asked

- what exactly are steps that should be taken when the trained posterior doesn't differ from the prior
- what are the possible reasons why the previous phenomena happend (not enough training? found the true parameters? -> this possible assumption doesn't always hold)
